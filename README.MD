This project is from hyperskill.
It's called Car Sharing. 
While implementing this project, I'm learning the basics of SQL and working wiht the H2 database.
UPD:
Stage 3. Added the car table. Now each company from company table has a bunch of cars in the car table. One to many relationship is used here.
