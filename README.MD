#This project is from hyperskill.<br />
It's called Car Sharing.<br />
While implementing this project, I'm learning the basics of SQL and working wiht the H2 database.
<br /><br/>UPD:
Stage 3. Added the car table. Now each company from company table has a bunch of cars in the car table. One to many relationship is used here.
<br /><br />UPD1: Stage 4. Added the customer table. Each customer has the ability to rent a car. If he does so then the id of chosen car will be written in customer table in column called rented_car_id
